# Module1_Excel
Finished homework 10/5/23 at 9:27p.m.
I had trouble on the last sheet
I learned how to use 'countifs' and worked on my pivot table skils
The issue was an if statement, "if x>=1, then return y" -> it would just add false and I couldn't figure out how to remove the 'false' responses
I still did the work, it might not be perfect, but I'm proud of the other 95%-98% of the work
Its only formatting, its only on the last piece
I did good, this is a reminder to future Jackie, you can do it
